# Project04_BeerReviews

## Team 
Rachad and Jonathon

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas in a real dataset, and use different visualization plots from matplotlib and Seaborn to present the data 

## Steps Followed 

- Load the data: excel file
- Analyze the data and create a plan for data preparation
- Use python to create function in order to follow the cleaning steps
- Brain storming to decide the matplotlib and seaborn plots to do
- Execute the plots

## Obstacles encountered 

- Name of beers were different than beer ID : beer ID depended on other factors than beer name
- All of our numerical data were scores from 1 to 5: Difficulties in establishing meaningful plots
- Complex plots to do: some plots were hard to establish and took longtime

## Lessons learned 

- We learned that it is more important to be able to highlight the incoherencies or mistakes than always replace it. 
- We learned how to maniplate matplotlib and seaborn
- Learned how to deviate from origin plan when the circumstances change

## Deliverables

- CSV file with clean data containing the results of our data wrangling work.
- Python files: python file 1 (data cleaning) / Python file 2 (first part of plots) / Python file 3 (second part of plots)
- Presentation: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFaeGvRYGI/oZee6ArvH-u6ul91Q0GPmg/edit?utm_source=shareButton&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=designshare#
- A README.md file containing a detailed explanation of the process followed and deliverables
